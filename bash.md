## Directory stack

The directory stack is a list of recently-visited directories. The `pushd` built-in adds directories to the stack as it changes the current directory, and the `popd` built-in removes specified directories from the stack and changes the current directory to the directory removed.

Content can be displayed issuing the `dirs` command or by checking the content of the `DIRSTACK` variable.
