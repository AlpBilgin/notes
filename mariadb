sudo apt-get install mariadb-server mariadb-client

 mysql_secure_installation


 cd /etc/mysql
$ sudo mkdir ssl
$ cd ssl

Note: Common Name value used for the server and client certificates/keys must each differ from the Common Name value used for the CA certificate. To avoid any issues, I am setting them as follows. Otherwise, you will get certification verification failed error. Hence set it as follows:
CA common Name : MariaDB admin
Server common Name: MariaDB server
Client common Name: MariaDB client

sudo openssl genrsa 4096 > ca-key.pem

 sudo openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -days 365000 -key ca-key.pem -out ca-cert.pem
