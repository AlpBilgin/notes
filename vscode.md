## remote wsl and file watching compilers

That's a known problem with the WSL file system implementation (Microsoft/WSL#3395, Microsoft/WSL#1956) caused by the file watcher active by VSCode. The issue will only be fixed in WSL 2.

To avoid the issue, set remote.WSL.fileWatcher.polling to true. However, polling based has a performance impact for large workspaces.

For large workspace you want to increase the polling interval: remote.WSL.fileWatcher.pollingInterval and control the folders that are watched: files.watcherExclude.

WSL 2 does not have that file watcher problem is also not affected by the new setting.
